"For each form of government, provide the average number of years that it was sustained."
ChatGPT
Here's an estimated **average lifespan** for each of the top 10 forms of government throughout world history, based on the duration of known examples. These are general averages — some outliers (like particularly long-lived or short-lived regimes) are excluded to give a more meaningful number. Keep in mind that some governments evolved or overlapped with others (e.g., monarchy within an empire).

---

### **1. Monarchy**
- **Average Duration:** ~300–400 years per monarchy
- **Notes:** Monarchies tend to be quite stable, often transitioning through dynasties rather than collapsing entirely.
- **Example:** Ancient Egypt’s monarchy lasted over 2,000 years (multiple dynasties); England’s monarchy has lasted over 1,000 years.

---

### **2. Tribalism / Chiefdom**
- **Average Duration:** ~500+ years per tribal society
- **Notes:** Hard to define exact endpoints since many existed before recorded history and continued without formal collapse.
- **Example:** Indigenous Australian systems lasted tens of thousands of years in various tribal forms.

---

### **3. Oligarchy**
- **Average Duration:** ~100–200 years per oligarchic regime
- **Notes:** Often replaced by monarchy or democracy. Tends to be unstable unless heavily entrenched.
- **Example:** Oligarchic Sparta lasted roughly 300 years; Venetian oligarchy lasted over 1,000 years (rare case).

---

### **4. Theocracy**
- **Average Duration:** ~150–300 years
- **Notes:** Can be stable if combined with monarchy (e.g., divine kingship). Often collapses or transitions due to secular revolutions.
- **Example:** Tibetan theocracy under the Dalai Lamas lasted about 370 years before Chinese annexation.

---

### **5. Empire**
- **Average Duration:** ~250–350 years per empire
- **Notes:** Some empires span centuries (e.g., Roman), but many collapse due to overextension or internal strife.
- **Example:** Roman Empire (as a united entity) lasted around 500 years; Ottoman Empire lasted over 600 years.

---

### **6. Democracy (Direct and Representative)**
- **Average Duration:** ~200 years (modern forms); ~100 years (ancient forms)
- **Notes:** Early democracies were fragile (e.g., Athens); modern democracies show greater resilience.
- **Example:** Athenian democracy lasted about 186 years (with interruptions); U.S. democracy is currently ~250 years old.

---

### **7. Republic**
- **Average Duration:** ~150–300 years
- **Notes:** Often transitions into empires or autocracies (e.g., Rome).
- **Example:** Roman Republic lasted ~482 years; the Republic of Venice lasted ~1,100 years (again, rare).

---

### **8. Feudalism**
- **Average Duration:** ~300–500 years
- **Notes:** Functions as a decentralized system and can persist under weak monarchies.
- **Example:** European feudalism lasted from ~800 to ~1500 CE (about 700 years in some areas).

---

### **9. Military Junta / Stratocracy**
- **Average Duration:** ~20–50 years
- **Notes:** Typically transitional governments. Tend to be short-lived due to lack of civil legitimacy.
- **Example:** Myanmar's military junta has ruled intermittently since 1962; most Latin American juntas lasted under 20 years.

---

### **10. Socialist / Communist States**
- **Average Duration:** ~50–100 years
